#autoparameter

Here we are attempting to automatically define parameters that separate kinases in the DFGin and DFGout conformations.

We are initially doing this with manually separated Src and Abl pdbs.

These pdbs were originally created using ensembler and were copied from:

/cbio/jclab/projects/parton/kinome-ensembler/models/SRC_HUMAN_D0/SRC_*

and

/cbio/jclab/projects/parton/kinome-ensembler/models/ABL1_HUMAN_D0/ABL1_*
