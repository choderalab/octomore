# dihedral-plot
Here are some plots of Src and Abl simulations according the dihedral angle suggested Lin...Roux, PNAS (2013) to be informative of the DFG-in vs. DFG-out conformation.

## Manifest
* `11400-1\` - analysis of new simulations seeded from ensembler, this includes 'lines' plots that mark where the simulation started
* `dihedral_matrix\` - a currently broken attempt to sample through various dihedrals to see if others around the activation loop were as or more representative of this conformational change than the original dihedral
* `new_dihedral\` - this is the same plot as the the original dihedral, but just choosing a random one instead ( a kind of control )
* `repeat\` - this is a repeat of the original dihedral script after the same sims had been running for slightly longer, there are a few small changes to this script
